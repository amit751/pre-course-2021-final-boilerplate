<p>hi this is my final project - a todo list. 
in this file will introduce the following topics: 
<ul>
<li>What does the app include</li>
<li>the repository</li>
<li> useful Links</li>
</ul>

<h2>Todo List Web Application</h2>
A todo List Web Application, in which the user can add and store prioritized todo tasks - view and sort that list. the tasks are saved at the localstorage, so localy the information is saved. <h3>there are the following options:</h3>
<p>When writing the task, you can select one of the categories - that is, the icons that symbolize: Tasks related to leisure work or home - respectively, next to the task, the icon is displayed. You dont have to use this fetcher.</p>

<p>It is possible to delete a task</p>
<p>It is possible to click on the text of the task itself and then it is marked with a cross line over the text, but it is not deleted and can be seen.</p>
<p>by clicking the marker button you can mark a task.<p>
<h3> The code works in such a way that each task is stored in an array of objects and each object has properties that relate to the task, even when a task is deleted by the client, it is not deleted from the array (database) it just changes it in status to: deleted. In addition there is an ID for each task so it can be tracked.<h3>
